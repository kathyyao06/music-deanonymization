# Deanonymization: Music Listening Activity

This projects attempts to deanonymize the last.fm dataset, which includes 92,800 artist listening records from 1892 users (https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/). This deanonymizes the last.fm dataset by matching the pseudonymous user IDs with the names on a non-anonymous music website (https://aifairness.tech/) using a similarity function.
